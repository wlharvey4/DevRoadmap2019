Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and
the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a frontend,
backend or a devops. I made these charts for an old professor of mine who
wanted something to share with his college students to give them a perspective;
sharing them here to help the community.

The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to
guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you
to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one
tool would better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and
trendy never means best suited for the job
